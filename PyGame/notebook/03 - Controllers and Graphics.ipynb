    "The best way to do this is to have a function that takes in an x and y coordinate, then draws an object at that location\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def draw_snowman(screen, x, y):\n",
    "    # Draw a circle for the head\n",
    "    pygame.draw.ellipse(screen, WHITE, [35 + x, y, 25, 25])\n",

    "## Best approach: use sprites\n",

    "\n",
    "Balls bouncing off paddles, laser beams hitting aliens, or our favorite character collecting a coin. All these examples require collision detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pygame library has support for `sprites`. \n",
    "A **sprite** is a two dimensional image that is part of the larger graphical scene. \n",
    "\n",
    "Typically a sprite will be some kind of object in the scene that will be interacted with like a car, frog, or little plumber guy.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now this specialized hardware support is no longer needed, but we still use the term “sprite.”"
