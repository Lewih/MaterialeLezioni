    "\n",
    "The apparent intelligence of an NPC is not always related to the amount of code used to simulate it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Players will tend to attribute intelligence to NPCs that is not really there. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the ant simulation, the ants will form an orderly queue when chasing the spider. \n",
    "\n",
    "A friend of mine saw this and remarked that they were cooperating in the hunt—but of course the ants were acting completely independently. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it can take surprisingly little work to convince the player that something is smart.\n",
    "\n",
    "State machines are a practical and easy way of implementing game AI because they break down a complex system (i.e., a brain) into smaller chunks that are easy to implement. \n",
    "\n",
    "They aren’t difficult to design because we are accustomed to imagining what other people or animals are thinking when they do things. \n",
    "\n",
    "It may not be practical to turn every thought into computer code, but you only need to approximate behavior to simulate it in a game.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simple state machine framework we created in this chapter can be used in your own games to build convincing AI. \n",
    "\n",
    "As with the ant simulation, start out by defining what the actions for your NPC are and then figure out what would make it switch between these actions. Once you have this laid out on paper, you can start building the individual states in code."
